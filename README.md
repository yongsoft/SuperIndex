# SuperIndex

**Structure-navigation retrieval for large document corpora — built on [PageIndex](https://github.com/VectifyAI/PageIndex).**

PageIndex answers *"where in this report is the figure?"*. SuperIndex answers the
question that comes first: **"which report?"** — across thousands of files spread
over a deep directory tree, with no vector store and no embedding model anywhere
in the stack.

---

## The problem

Vector RAG retrieves passages that are *similar* to the question. On financial
and regulatory documents that is frequently the wrong passage. Two years'
dividend notes differ by a single digit, so their embeddings are nearly
identical — and when we measured it on a real corpus, **57% of chunks had a
near-duplicate in another document**, some of them character-for-character
identical. No embedding model can separate those, because the input is the same.

PageIndex takes a different route: it builds an explicit tree over a document and
has the model *reason* about which node to open. Answers trace back to a page
number instead of a cosine score.

That solves it for **one** document. But a real corpus is not one document. It is
thousands of files, organised in directories several levels deep, and the first
question a user asks is which file to look in at all. Hand a model a flat list of
1,000 filenames and it is guessing.

**SuperIndex adds the missing level.**

---

## What you get

### Navigate a corpus, not a document

A three-level addressing model — **corpus → document → section** — where each
level is a separate index sized so the cheap one stays resident and the expensive
one is fetched on demand.

```
question
 ├─ L0  which file?      read the whole directory tree, model picks 1–4 directories
 ├─ L1  which file?      list files under those, model picks 1–5
 └─ L2  which section?   read each candidate's chapter tree, model picks 1–6
        ↓
      section text + provenance
```

Three model decisions, each with a deterministic fallback. **Cost does not grow
with directory depth**, because the directory tree is far smaller than the file
count — 144 files lived in 229 directories in our test corpus, and the whole
directory listing fits in one prompt at ~2K tokens.

### Business knowledge lives in a config file, not in the router

The router ships with sensible defaults for an *unknown* corpus. Inside a
company the corpus is not unknown: someone knows that statutory reports live
under `annual/`, that `_drafts/` must never be searched, that "友邦" and "AIA"
are the same company. That knowledge belongs to the business, so it belongs in
`config/routing_policy.yaml` — editable without touching Python, and re-read on
every question so there is nothing to restart.

```yaml
directories:
  exclude: [_drafts, templates, .trash]     # the only hard filter
  weights:                                  # bias the ranking, don't gate it
    - { pattern: annual, weight: 3, label: 法定年报 }
  scopes:                                   # advisory: rendered into the prompt
    - name: 财务指标
      dirs: [annual, interim]
      note: VONB / OPAT / 股息这类数字先看这里
periods:
  patterns: ['FY\s?(\d{2,4})']              # FY24 → 2024, so it matches the path
aliases:
  友邦: [AIA, 友邦保险]                      # synonym expansion in the fallback
```

Two properties make this safe to hand to a business owner:

* **An empty policy is a no-op.** Delete the file and routing behaves exactly
  as it did before the feature existed. `tests/test_policy.py` pins this down
  assertion by assertion.
* **A broken policy is never fatal.** A YAML typo degrades to the built-in
  defaults, prints one line, and records the failure in
  `results/logs/errors.jsonl` with `where: policy.load`. The app keeps answering
  questions while someone fixes the file.

Every query records which policy was in effect, so "I added a weight and nothing
changed" is answerable after the fact. See
[`config/routing_policy.yaml`](config/routing_policy.yaml) for the full format.

### Scales cheaply, and you can measure it before spending

Structural indexing needs **no LLM and no API key**.

| | |
|---|---|
| Structural index build | **0.09 s** for 144 files / 2,304 chapter nodes |
| Routing index size | **125 KB** — small enough to hold in memory and re-read per query |
| Full directory-tree listing | **8,904 characters** (~2K tokens) |

You can index an entire corpus, inspect the structure, and decide whether it is
worth summarising — before paying for anything.

### Where the time goes on a question

Measured over 21 recorded queries (`results/logs/queries.jsonl`):

| Stage | Mean | Max | Share |
|---|---|---|---|
| **answer generation** | **17.9 s** | 93.3 s | **77%** |
| routing — pick directories, then files (2 calls) | 4.2 s | 12.7 s | 18% |
| section selection — one call per candidate file | 1.2 s | 2.8 s | 5% |
| **end to end** | **23.3 s** | 114.0 s | — |

The dominant cost is not retrieval and not the context: the slowest query on
record spent **93 s answering from a 3 KB context**. It is the model's thinking.
`reasoning_effort` is not a usable brake here — turning it off entirely moved
thinking from 804 to 722 characters on the same prompt. So the lever that
matters is showing the work rather than trying to shorten it, which is what the
collapsible thinking panel does. Section selection is the one stage that was
purely wasteful: the per-file calls are independent, so they now run
concurrently (4 files × 0.25 s measured at 0.26 s, not 1.0 s).

### Better text in, better answers out

Upstream reads the PDF text layer with PyPDF2. On table-heavy documents that
falls apart: a bar-chart page flattens to `175230`, two numbers fused, with the
label-to-value association gone. Scanned PDFs are refused outright.

SuperIndex makes extraction **pluggable**, with **Azure Document Intelligence as
the default whenever it is configured**:

| | text layer | Azure Document Intelligence |
|---|---|---|
| Tables | mangled | **real Markdown tables** |
| Scanned / image-only | refused | **OCR'd** |
| Page anchors | synthesised | injected at real page boundaries |

Set two environment variables and every entry point takes it up automatically —
no flag to remember. **The backend never switches silently**, and a
configured-but-failing backend aborts rather than quietly degrading index quality.

### A PDF still gets a real chapter tree without Azure

With no Azure configured, the chapter tree comes from PageIndex's offline
**`flash`** engine, which derives headings from font size, position and layout
statistics — no LLM, no network. On the AIA FY2022 report that is the difference
between **312 nodes all named `Page N`** and **469 nodes across 5 levels with
real titles** (`CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT`, `FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS`, …).

The full order for a PDF is:

| # | Path | When |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Azure DI** | configured — real Markdown, tables preserved |
| 2 | **flash** | offline layout analysis, free |
| 3 | one node per page | so nothing is ever unreachable |
| 4 | the PDF's own bookmarks | no usable text layer at all |

### Upstream stays pristine

SuperIndex is a **layer, not a fork**. Not one file inside `PageIndex/` is
modified — the engine is vendored at a pinned commit, and every customisation is
applied from outside at runtime. `git pull` inside `PageIndex/` stays clean.

### No vectors, anywhere

No vector store, no embedding model, not even `numpy` in the dependency list.
Every answer is traceable to a file and a page.

### A UI for managing corpora

`webapp/` is a browser UI over everything above — no build step, no Node, no
frontend framework, just a stdlib HTTP server and one HTML file.

- **Drop a folder in, it gets indexed.** `data/` is the default document root:
  every immediate subdirectory becomes a corpus automatically, and new folders
  are picked up by the watcher. No registration step, no path to type.
- **Add directories from the browser.** For anything outside `data/`, a
  read-only directory picker walks the filesystem.
- **Watch indexing happen.** Each corpus shows its own status, current stage,
  and file / directory / chapter counts. Indexing runs in the background, so the
  UI stays responsive.
- **Scope questions by directory.** Indexed corpora are in scope automatically,
  or tick a subset to narrow it. Multi-corpus questions are routed in one call —
  the merged tree puts every corpus at the top level, so the model compares
  branches across corpora instead of guessing.
- **Changes are picked up automatically.** A watcher polls each directory, and
  when files are added, edited or deleted it re-extracts only those files and
  regenerates only their descriptions. Unchanged documents keep their existing
  summaries, so a one-file edit costs one file's worth of work.
- **Example questions, derived from the corpus.** The chips above the input box
  are generated from the corpus itself — its description, directory topics, file
  summaries and section titles — so they ask about things the index can actually
  answer. A hand-written demo question only fits the corpus it was written for;
  a generated one fits whatever you drop in. Questions you have already asked
  come back as a dropdown when the box is focused, so a repeat is one click.
- **Answers stay auditable.** The chat shows the navigation trace — which
  directories, files and sections the model chose, and which fallback fired if
  it hesitated — alongside the streamed answer and its sources. Sources are
  **grouped by document**, one row each, with the hit sections as inline chips:
  a document that supplies four sections would otherwise repeat its full path
  four times. On a real 12-hit / 4-document query that is 244px of citation
  down to 145px.
- **You can see it thinking, and you can stop it.** Reasoning models spend most
  of their wall clock on tokens nobody asked for: on our own measurement of
  `deepseek-flash`, **240 of 269 streamed chunks were thinking and 27 were
  answer**. Those tokens are generated either way, so the UI forwards them
  instead of discarding them. Retrieval path and reasoning share **one** box,
  because they are two halves of the same story — where the model looked, then
  what it made of it — and two separate disclosures just make you open the same
  thing twice. It starts filling within the first second and folds away the
  moment the answer begins, leaving `检索过程 · 思考 498 字` behind as the
  summary. The box has a **fixed height** and scrolls internally: when its
  height tracked its content, every new retrieval step — and the thinking panel
  appearing — pushed the rest of the page down while the answer was still
  streaming. When a model spirals — the slowest query we recorded took **114 s**
  on a 3 KB context — Send becomes **Stop**, and a cancelled query is logged as
  a cancel rather than an error.

```bash
python webapp/server.py          # http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

### Diagnostics included

Retrieval quality problems are usually measurable before they are fixable:

| Tool | Answers |
|---|---|
| `scripts/04_md_audit.py` | Will this Markdown index well? Predicts the tree **without running an LLM** |
| `scripts/05_similarity_probe.py` | How much cross-document duplication is polluting retrieval? |
| `scripts/profile_query.py` | Where is the latency actually going? |
| `scripts/03_md_tree_probe.py` | What tree will a given Markdown file produce? |

### Tested offline

**488 assertions** across the extraction, navigation, registry, LLM-retry,
logging, policy and suggestion layers, with no network and no credentials
required:

```bash
python tests/test_azure_di.py    # 28 assertions — config, page markers, error mapping
python tests/test_backend.py     # 25 assertions — backend resolution, page splitting
python tests/test_registry.py    # 135 assertions — registry, change detection, watcher, drop zone
python tests/test_llm_retry.py   # 49 assertions — token-budget escalation, stream fallback, thinking/content split
python tests/test_debuglog.py    # 44 assertions — query/error records, rotation, filters
python tests/test_policy.py      # 132 assertions — routing policy, incl. "empty = no-op", parallel section order
python tests/test_suggest.py     # 75 assertions — example-question generation and caching
```

`test_backend.py` reports 27 once the sample PDFs are present; without them the
two PDF-dependent assertions skip rather than fail, so the suite is runnable on a
bare clone. `test_registry.py` builds its own fixtures in a temp directory and
indexes with descriptions disabled, so it never calls an LLM.
`test_policy.py` and `test_suggest.py` stub the LLM and write only to temp
directories, so they never touch `results/logs/`.

**[`docs/ArchitectureIntro.html`](docs/ArchitectureIntro.html) has the full
picture** — 8 diagrams covering both the upstream engine and SuperIndex, the
storage model, and the design decisions that turned out to be load-bearing.
It is self-contained: open it in a browser, no server needed.

---

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yongsoft/SuperIndex.git
cd SuperIndex

# 1. PageIndex is vendored, so one clone is enough. Only the sample PDFs
#    are fetched separately (~27 MB, publicly downloadable).
bash data/aia_reports/download.sh

# 2. Environment — Python 3.10 or newer
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt    # includes PageIndex's pinned set
pip install -e PageIndex --no-deps

# 3. Build a navigation index over a directory of documents.
#    This step needs no LLM and no API key.
python -m nav.build /path/to/your/corpus --out corpus_index

# 4. Generate summaries so routing has something to reason over  [needs an LLM]
python -m nav.build /path/to/your/corpus --out corpus_index --summarize-files

# 5. Ask a question
python -m nav.route corpus_index "What was the dividend per share in 2024?"
```

**Two install steps, on purpose.** `requirements.txt` pulls in the pinned set
from `PageIndex/requirements.txt` (installing straight from upstream's
`pyproject.toml` makes pip backtrack badly on its unpinned `litellm` /
`openai-agents` ranges — the pinned file resolves in seconds). The package
itself is then added with `--no-deps` because its dependencies are already
satisfied.

`nav.build` accepts **`.md`, `.markdown`, `.txt` and `.pdf`** and walks nested
directories. It is incremental — unchanged files are skipped, so re-running after
adding a few documents is cheap.

### Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. It documents every knob, including the optional
Azure Document Intelligence section. The only required value for the offline
path is nothing at all; for summarisation and QA you need one LLM provider key.

Business routing rules live in a separate file, [`config/routing_policy.yaml`](config/routing_policy.yaml)
— see [above](#business-knowledge-lives-in-a-config-file-not-in-the-router).
Point `SUPERINDEX_ROUTING_POLICY` at another path to keep it out of the checkout.

### Options worth knowing

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--extractor {auto,azure-di,text-layer}` | Force a backend, to measure what Azure DI actually buys on your corpus |
| `--summarize-files` / `--summarize-chapters` | Generate routing summaries (incremental, LLM-backed) |
| `--max-files N` | Limit scope while evaluating |
| `--json` (on `nav.route`) | Machine-readable output: selected files, sections, line ranges |
| `--show-policy` (on `nav.route`) | Print which routing policy is in effect, then exit |
| `--policy PATH` / `--corpus NAME` (on `nav.route`) | Override the policy file, or bind a per-corpus overlay |

---

## Web UI

```bash
python webapp/server.py                      # http://127.0.0.1:8787
python webapp/server.py --port 9000          # different port
python webapp/server.py --no-watch           # do not poll for file changes
python webapp/server.py --watch-interval 10  # poll every 10s instead of 30s
```

### Just drop documents into `data/`

`data/` is the default document root. **Each immediate subdirectory becomes a
corpus automatically** — the server registers it on startup, and the watcher
picks up new folders within one poll interval (30s by default):

```bash
cp -r ~/Documents/2024-filings   data/       # → indexed automatically
mkdir data/contracts && cp *.pdf data/contracts/
```

```
data/
├── 中国太保/           → corpus
├── 友邦保险/           → corpus
├── contracts/         → corpus (added later, picked up by the watcher)
└── aia_reports/       → corpus
```

A small synthetic corpus (`中国太保/`, `中国平安/`, `友邦保险/`, `行业汇总/`)
ships with the repo, so a fresh clone is demo-ready. Folders with nothing
indexable (empty, or only `.sh`) are skipped, so a stray directory does not
create an empty corpus. Everything under `data/` is **read-only** — indexes go
to `index/`, never back into `data/`.

> Only PDFs are gitignored (the AIA reports are 27 MB; fetch them with
> `data/aia_reports/download.sh`). **Anything else you drop into `data/` will be
> committed** — keep private documents outside the repo and register them with
> the directory browser instead.

To index something outside `data/`, use **添加目录** in the UI — a read-only
directory browser, which also opens at `data/` by default.

`SUPERINDEX_DATA_DIR` moves the drop zone; `SUPERINDEX_INDEX_DIR` moves the
index store.

A question can also be deep-linked, which is handy for sharing:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8787/?q=<url-encoded question>
```

### The API underneath

The UI is a thin client over six endpoints, so anything it does is scriptable:

| | |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/state` | corpora, statuses, watcher state, models |
| `GET /api/browse?path=` | list sub-directories (read-only, names only) |
| `POST /api/corpora` | `{path, name?, deep_index?}` — register and start indexing |
| `PATCH /api/corpora/<id>` | `{name}` — rename |
| `DELETE /api/corpora/<id>` | unregister and delete the index |
| `POST /api/corpora/<id>/reindex` | `{deep_index?, force?}` |
| `POST /api/ask` | `{question, corpus_ids?}` → SSE: `stage`, `nav`, `sources`, `answer`, `done` |

### Where the indexes live

**All index data goes to one place in the project — `index/` — while the source
files stay exactly where they are.**

```
index/
├── registry.json            registered corpora: source path, status, stats
└── corpora/<id>/            one index per registered directory
    ├── manifest.json          directory tree + per-file descriptions
    └── trees/<key>.json       chapter tree + source lines per document
```

**That is the whole store — there is no second one.** The CLI and diagnostic
scripts under `scripts/` write to `results/` instead, because their output is
experiment material rather than something the app reads at query time. So
`SUPERINDEX_INDEX_DIR` moves the product index and nothing else, and there is no
"half the indexes followed it" surprise.

Registering `/data/reports` writes **only** to `index/corpora/<id>/`; the source
directory is never written to. The registry stores the source's **absolute
path**, so indexes and sources can move independently. Deleting `index/` loses
nothing — every corpus rebuilds from its source. See
[`index/README.md`](index/README.md), or set `SUPERINDEX_INDEX_DIR` to put the
whole store on a bigger volume.

### How indexing and watching work

- Each corpus gets **its own index directory**, so one failing corpus cannot
  corrupt another and removal is a clean delete.
- Indexing is **incremental**. A file whose size and mtime are unchanged is not
  re-extracted — which matters because otherwise every watcher tick would
  re-send every PDF to Azure Document Intelligence.
- Only files **without** a description get summarised, so a single-file edit
  costs one summary rather than a full re-index.
- A corpus registered with descriptions off **stays** off: the watcher honours
  the corpus's own settings rather than assuming an LLM is available.
- If a registered directory disappears, the corpus is marked `error` with a
  readable message instead of silently returning nothing.
- Registering a directory **inside the project** is refused — it would recurse
  into `index/` while that same index is being written.

---

## Debugging

Every question is logged, so a wrong answer can be diagnosed after the fact
rather than guessed at. Two append-only JSONL streams under `results/logs/`:

| File | What's in it |
|---|---|
| `queries.jsonl` | one record per question: scope, every routing decision, sources read, the answer, per-stage timings |
| `errors.jsonl` | one record per exception: type, message, full traceback, and the context in flight |

Both carry a shared id, so an exception can be joined back to the query it
belongs to. Read them without the server running:

```bash
python scripts/07_logs.py                     # recent queries, one line each
python scripts/07_logs.py --failed            # only the ones that failed or found nothing
python scripts/07_logs.py --id q-1a2b3c4d     # one query in full, plus any exception
python scripts/07_logs.py --kind errors       # recent exceptions
python scripts/07_logs.py --stats
```

`--id` prints the whole story, which is what makes a bad answer actionable:

```
  问题   : 友邦保险 2024 年全年的每股股息是多少？
  范围   : aia_reports, 中国太保, 中国平安, 友邦保险, 行业汇总
  耗时   : route=2.7s  sections=0.8s  answer=1.2s

  检索路径 3 步:
    [dir    ] 全树 29 个目录
              → 610b3c99/2024/annual, 610b3c99/2024
    [chapter] 610b3c99/2024/annual/AIA_AR2024.md
              → 股息, 财务摘要
```

The timings tell you where to look: routing dominates here, so that is where a
latency fix would pay off.

Each record also names the routing policy that was in effect, so "I added a
directory weight and nothing changed" has a definitive answer: either the policy
file was not found (`source` empty), or it loaded and the weight simply did not
match. See [`config/routing_policy.yaml`](config/routing_policy.yaml).

`GET /api/logs?kind=queries|errors&limit=N&failed=1` serves the same data to the
UI. Set `SUPERINDEX_DEBUG_LOG=0` to turn logging off, `SUPERINDEX_LOG_DIR` to
move it. Logging never breaks the app — a write failure prints one line to
stderr and is otherwise swallowed.

---

## Try it on the sample corpus

The repository ships a **16-file synthetic corpus** with a realistic three-level
directory structure, plus a pre-built index, so you can see the navigator work
before touching your own data:

```bash
$PY -m nav.route samples/test_index "友邦保险 2024 年全年的每股股息是多少？"
```

```
  [目录] 全树 28 个 → 选 1 个
      友邦保险/2024/annual/
  [文件] 1 个候选 → 选 1 个
      友邦保险/2024/annual/AIA_AR2024.md
  [章节] AIA_AR2024.md (15 节点) → 股息, 主席报告
```

Separately, the project uses **AIA Group's published annual and interim reports**
as a real-world PDF sample — long, table-heavy, and full of the cross-year
duplication that breaks similarity search. Ten reports, 2,640 pages, downloaded
by the script above. They are there to exercise the PDF path and to give the
diagnostics something real to measure; nothing in the code is specific to AIA.

---

## When to use this

**Good fit**

- Thousands of documents in a nested directory structure
- Answers must be traceable to a source and a page
- Documents where near-duplicate text across versions is common (reports,
  filings, contracts, standards)
- Table-heavy or scanned PDFs, where you can enable Azure DI
- You want to index a corpus before committing to a per-page extraction bill

**Poor fit**

- A handful of short documents — plain PageIndex or a simple prompt will do
- Questions that need arithmetic across documents (see limitations)
- A corpus with no meaningful directory structure and no useful filenames
- Latency budgets under a second — navigation costs several LLM round trips

---

## Limitations

Stated plainly, because they are the questions a new user hits first.

| Limit | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Locating ≠ computing** | The navigator finds the right section. If the answer needs arithmetic across sections, the model still does it by reading text. Numbers need a structured path — see [`docs/dify-improvement-plan.md`](docs/dify-improvement-plan.md). |
| **Chapter summaries need an LLM** | A one-time per-corpus cost. Without them, section selection degrades to token matching. |
| **Scanned PDFs still need Azure DI** | A PDF is no longer reduced to one node per page: PageIndex's offline `flash` engine builds a real chapter tree from layout statistics. But a PDF with *no text layer at all* still needs Azure DI's OCR. |
| **Directory quality sets the ceiling** | Thousands of files flattened into one directory degrade level 0 to listing thousands of names. That is a corpus-organisation problem. |
| **Fallbacks match tokens, not synonyms** | "Life insurance" will not match a directory named `人身险`. The `aliases:` block in `config/routing_policy.yaml` fixes the cases you can name; an embedding pre-filter would generalise, at the cost of reintroducing the similarity problem the design avoids. |
| **The policy biases, it does not reason** | Weights and scopes nudge a model that is already looking at the candidates. They cannot rescue a question whose answer is genuinely absent, and a wrong `exclude` will hide a directory — which is why exclusions match whole path segments rather than substrings. |
| **Validated on synthetic corpora** | 16-file and 144-file corpora with known structure. The scale numbers are real; routing accuracy on a genuinely messy production corpus is not yet measured. |
