"""
Example questions a corpus can actually answer — the chips above the input box.

Why these are generated rather than written by hand
---------------------------------------------------
A hand-written demo question ("2024 年全年股息是多少？") is only useful for the
corpus it was written for. Ship it against a different corpus and it teaches the
user to ask something the index cannot answer — which reads as a *retrieval*
failure when it is really a *suggestion* failure. That is the worst kind of
first impression: the product looks broken on the one question it proposed.

So the questions are derived from the corpus itself, using the same evidence
routing uses: the corpus description, the directory topics, file summaries, and
section titles. Section titles are the strongest signal — "股息", "新业务价值",
"分市场表现" are literally the names of things that can be asked about.

Cost and failure
----------------
One call per corpus, cached in the registry and invalidated by the same content
fingerprint that invalidates the corpus summary. On any failure this returns an
empty list: the UI hides the chips. **No question is better than a wrong
question**, because a wrong one wastes the user's first click and makes the
index look worse than it is.
